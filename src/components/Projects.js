            say that I hope I beat you to it! Eileen is the single most

            A combination of tactical precision and a polished, client-friendly
            nature made her a standout talent for client-services roles; her
            trajectory in taking on increasing responsibility was exponential.

            One of the biggest wins in our agency's history was due in
            no-small-part to Eileen's work ethic and capacity to work rungs
            above her duties.‚Äù
